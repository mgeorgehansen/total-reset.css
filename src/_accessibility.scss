/**
 * 1. Remove the outline on focused elements that all major browers add.
 *
 *    Ok, this is going to be *super* controversial but hear me out. Yes,
 *    accessability on focusable elements is really important and needs to be
 *    addressed in any design, but the default styling may not work for every
 *    design. For instance, a site with lots of grays would make the default
 *    focus outline difficult to see. Rather than try to guess what the best
 *    focus indicator should be for every design I argue that this is the
 *    responsibility of the designer to figure out. There is an argument to be
 *    made for standard and expected behavior, but it is easy enough to add
 *    a focus outline back in the application styling if that's what you want.
