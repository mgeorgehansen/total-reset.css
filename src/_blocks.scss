/**
 * 1. Set all visible elements with default inline, inline-block and block to
 *    display as blocks.
 *
 *    This might be controversial, but my position is that inline vs block
 *    display is a visual style and that block display is the most reasonable
 *    default for consistent styling. Rather than maintaining a mental map of
 *    which elements are _supposed_ to be inline vs block you can always rely
 *    on the fact that *all* elements are block by default. Except checkboxes
 *    and radios of course, because reasons.
